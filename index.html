                    <p>My name is Rukiyyah Balazon Waheed, but people usually address me with the name "Ruki." I was born in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Riyadh on January 23, 1998. Basically, I am 17 years old and I'm going to turn 18 after 1 month. I was raised by the most amazing parents in the world. What is my nationality you ask? Well, let me clarify this. My mom is Filipino and my dad is Pakistani and with that awesome combination, I call myself a Pakilino! I am very blessed and thankful for this amazing gift God has to given to me. I've always been an artistic person eversince I was a child. Though I’m not really sure if it has been a talent or skill, but people would tell me that it’s both.</p>
                    <p>I’ve been living in Saudi Arabia for more than 15 years. In fact, I’ve spent most of my lifetime there in the Arabian country. I studied in a Filipino school called “Riyadh International School” or in short term “RIS.” During my kindergarten and grade 1, I didn’t have much of friends honestly. I did have some mates though but they didn’t tend to stay with me longer than I expected. I was mostly being bullied due to my size. But as a child, it didn’t really matter to me. Later on, my parents decided to put a halt on my Filipino school because I already got to learn Tagalog and also they wanted me to learn about Islam and the Urdu language(my father's language) since they didn’t teach about it in the Filipino school. Eventually, I was shifted to an English medium Pakistani school called “Al-Iqbal International School” or in short term “AIIS.” I only spent 3 years there on my elementary grades, grade 2, 3 and 4.</p>

                    <p>Life was good there; I used to get a lot of honours and awards in class. I even made a lot of friends on which I still have contact with them until this day. After my third year there, we were told that the school had issues and it will transfer to another building. So basically, it’s not like I “actually” changed school but I get to continue with the same teachers and students. Some of the teachers and students left though, on the other hand, there were few of them too. The school didn’t keep its name too. It changed from “AIIS” to “LOIS” which is “Learning Oasis International School.” Luckily, my best friends stayed. I got to make new friends too. I was mostly the kind of “sporty” and “famous” kind of person during that time. I stayed there for only 2 years which was grade 5 and 6 then; I got to shift again because the teachings have changed from good to bad. I was transferred to “Jawahir Al-Riyadh International School” or in short “JARIS.” Obviously, I spent my entire high school years there. I’ve gotten adjusted to the society there more. Though, their teaching structure was more strict, depressing and stressful. We mostly focused on an examination called “IGCSE.” This exam was being checked in UK. This school actually didn’t have any parties or any fun activities at all. They only wanted us to focus on studying and take everything seriously.</p>

                    <p>This crisis made me a very naughty student. I was a rule breaker, I would bunk classes, bully students, never study well for exams and I mostly spent my time with students that have a bad influence. This attitude made a great disastrous change in my life. Depression did kick in sooner; I was bullied back for my looks so I was really suicidal at that time. I also got a sickness called “Eating Disorder” or “ED” where I didn’t eat at all. The type of eating disorder that I has was called "Anorexia." It is the type of eating disorder where a person wouldn't eat or drink at all and lose all of the weight within weeks and months causing the person to be weak and really, it is fatal. At that time of the year, I got anorexia. I lost a lot of weight within a month. It was around 17-18 kg of weight that I shed of. I would come to school looking extremely pale and tired. Some people assumed that I was on a diet which was completely wrong. They thought I have some special workout to lose a lot of weight within a month. I was self-harming as well. I would create scars on my wrists and other parts of my body. Some people said that it was great that I got this disorder. Know why? They said I looked better thinnner and they wanted me to continue though they didn't know that eventually, at a specific point, I would have died. I myself didn't understand the whole point of my sickness. </p>

                    <p>I thought I was on a diet but then after diagnosing myself, I realized I was anorexic. At some point though, people showed me support and told me to love myself the way I am cause God made me this way. Slowly, I started accepting myself and starting eating too. I did regain my weight back and I would get depressed at times but I try to stay strong. Moving on, I graduated from high school and I decided to study on the Philippines. I chose the University of the Cordilleras since I saw that it seemed more suitable and it looked environmentally friendly. When I finally came to the Philippines, I was sadly told that I had to repeat my 4th year of high school due to some conflict. I had no choice, but to do it. It was quite upsetting to be honest but I had to accept the challenge. They recommended me the University of Cordilleras high school so that we won’t have to take any exam while enrolling in the college the next year. So, I followed along. After all the stress was over, I finally graduated and now I am here. In the University of Cordilleras as 2nd year student taking the course of Computer Science and focusing on the track of Digital Arts and Animation.</p>
